[ ] Firmware
  [ ] Evaluate progress of the program
  [ ] Support basic features
    [ ] Sensor test:
      [ ] x-start
      [ ] x-end
      [ ] y-start
      [ ] y-end
      [ ] z-start
      [ ] z-end
      [ ] x-rot1
      [ ] x-rot2
      [ ] y-rot1
      [ ] y-rot2
      [ ] z-rot1
      [ ] z-rot2
      [ ] calculated x-pos
          Acceptance criteria: it counts in units from an internal counter that is reset during calibration
      [ ] calculated y-pos
          Acceptance criteria: it counts in units from an internal counter that is reset during calibration
      [ ] calculated z-pos
          Acceptance criteria: it counts in units from an internal counter that is reset during calibration
    [ ] Calibration and start
      [ ] Go to x-start, count to x-end, go to x-start, store x-end, reset x-pos
      [ ] Go to y-start, count to y-end, go to y-start, store y-end, reset y-pos
      [ ] Go to z-start, count to z-end, go to z-start, store z-end, reset z-pos
      [ ] Print measured size
    [ ] Operation
      [ ] Print position and status
      [ ] Simple traverse across axis
        [ ] X axis
        [ ] Y axis
        [ ] Z axis
      [ ] Emergency stop
      [ ] g-code to serial driver
        [ ] Add progress/percentage
      [ ] Print success at going to position
      [ ] Interpolated go to position
        [ ] Initially simple interpolation: step by step, no PWM
[ ] Box electronics
